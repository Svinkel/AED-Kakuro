The black cells are divided diagonally in 2 with the lower part being the sum of all cells beneath this until another black cell is reached while the top part is the sum of all cells to his right.

To invoke the program use: 
* make
* crosssums puzzle.cfg
  * crosssums is the output file of make and
  * puzzle.cfg is the puzzle to be solved
  
The puzzle solution will be placed in a file with .sol extension.
